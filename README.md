# Image-Captioning-Project
Generate caption on images using CNN Encoder- LSTM Decoder structure

This project is the second project of Udacity's Computer Vision Nanodegree and combines computer vision and machine translation techniques. The project's objective is a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture to generate natural sentences describing an image. The model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the target description sentence given the training image.

The principles of this technique was presented in the following [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) back in 2015. It was later enriched in "Show, Attend and Tell" [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03044) from 2016. I covered an implementation of this approach in another [repository](https://github.com/LaurentVe/Automatic-image-Captioning) for those interested. I also covered an implementation of Image Captioning in Keras on the Flickr dataset [here](https://github.com/LaurentVe/Image-Captioning-full-Encoder-Decoder-model-).

# Description
The notebook uses Pytorch and the MS COCO dataset for training. COCO is a large image dataset designed for object detection, segmentation, person keypoints detection, stuff segmentation, and caption generation. The dataset contains images with 5 pre-made captions each. The large majority of these captions are between 8 to 15 words long.
COCO datasets can be found [here](https://cocodataset.org/#download).

The model is composed of two parts:
- An Encoder wich uses pre-trained ResNet50 network to extract features from the images. The feature volume is passed thru a fully connected layer with the same number of nodes as the word embedding used in the second part below. This allows to combine extracted spacial features from the images and the sampled captions during training. I added a Batchnorm1d layer at the end.
- A Decoder primarily composed of a LSTM network. The decoder takes on the sample captions during the training phase and generates a caption for a new image during inference, 'decoding' the proposed features extracted from the image. A fully connected layer at the end allows to map the hidden space of the LSTM to the vocab space, producing a prediction for each word sequentially.

# Parameters of the Decoder model
Based on previous literature (see this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf)), I used the following hyperparameters:
- word Embedding dimension of 512
- Hidden dimension of 512
- Batch size of 256
- One LSTM layer
- Vocab threshold of 5 (vocabulary composed by the words with 5 occurences or more in the training dataset). Total vocabulary of 8.855 words.

Overall the model has 12.227.735 learnable parameters (the pre-trained CNN extractor is fixed).

I used both SGD and Adam optimizer. Results achieved after one epoch were promising in both cases. Samples are shown below.

## Results

After one epoch using SGD optimizer (lr=0.01, no momentum). Some context of the image is captured in the propsoed caption which is still approximative ('surfboard' and 'ocean' correct, 'ridding' not correct).
